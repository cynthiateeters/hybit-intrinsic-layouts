      "title": "🎯 The Question That Changed Everything",
      "content": "Prof. Teeters asked me: <em>\"HAP, what happens on the 847 screen sizes in between your breakpoints?\"</em> and I had NO answer! I was designing for exactly 3 sizes: mobile (320px), tablet (768px), desktop (1024px). But what about 375px? 414px? 1366px? 1920px? That question started my journey from <strong>fixed thinking</strong> (be exactly this size) to <strong>intrinsic thinking</strong> (adapt to any size). Now my layouts work on screens I've never even seen!"

Each station shares a mistake I made and what Prof. Teeters taught me to fix it!"

      "title": "🎯 Why Intrinsic Thinking Changed Everything",
      "content": "Prof. Teeters asked me <em>\"HAP, what happens on the 847 screen sizes in between your breakpoints?\"</em> and my brain exploded! I realized I was thinking in <strong>fixed instructions</strong> (be exactly 300px) instead of <strong>flexible rules</strong> (be between 16rem and 60rem based on space). That question shifted my entire mindset from pixels to intrinsic design."

      "title": "💥 My 300px Card Disaster",
      "content": "I made these beautiful 300px-wide cards. Mobile (375px)? Horizontal scroll disaster! Tablet (768px)? Tiny and awkward with huge margins! Desktop (1440px)? Cards looked cramped when 600px would fit perfectly! Prof. Teeters showed me <code>width: clamp(16rem, 45vw, 60rem)</code> and suddenly my cards adapted to <em>every</em> screen automatically!"

Change one value, update entire site! Now my spacing scale goes from <code>--space-xs</code> to <code>--space-xl</code> and everything stays systematic and consistent!"

      "content": "<code>min-content</code> = narrowest possible without overflow (text wraps to multiple lines). <code>max-content</code> = one long line, as wide as needed. I tested both on my navigation and the difference was HUGE! <code>min-content</code> made items stack narrow, <code>max-content</code> gave each item its natural width. Prof. Teeters: <em>\"Let the content tell you what it needs!\"</em>"

    "station2-navigation": {
      "title": "🧭 Navigation That Knows Its Size",
      "content": "My nav had labels like \"Home\" (short) and \"Documentation\" (long). Fixed widths? Looked terrible!

      "content": "Prof. Teeters showed me <code>.card:has(img) { padding: 2rem; }</code> and I was AMAZED! Cards <em>with</em> images automatically got more padding. Cards <em>without</em> images stayed compact. <strong>No classes needed!</strong> The CSS <em>looked</em> at the content and adapted spacing. Mind = blown 🤯"

    "station3-mistake": {
      "title": "❌ My Arbitrary Percentage Mistake",
      "content": "I tried <code>clamp(1rem, 5%, 3rem)</code> because 5% seemed reasonable. Sometimes 5% was HUGE (wide parent), sometimes tiny (narrow parent)! Prof. Teeters explained: <em>\"That 5% is relative to the parent element's width, not the viewport! It doesn't scale predictably!\"</em> That's when I learned the computed slope formula. Never again!"

      "title": "⚡ The Magic Pattern Explained",
      "content": "<code>grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(16rem, 1fr))</code> is pure magic! The browser calculates how many 16rem-minimum columns fit, then gives each equal share of leftover space. Mobile (320px)? 1 column! Desktop (1440px)? 5 columns! Ultrawide (3840px)? 15 columns! <strong>No media queries needed!</strong> Prof. Teeters: <em>\"Stop saying '3 columns'—start saying 'as many as fit with 16rem minimum!'\"</em>"

      "title": "🎯 auto-fit vs auto-fill Finally Clear",
      "content": "I was SO confused until I tested side-by-side! <code>auto-fit</code>: Empty tracks collapse, so 3 cards expand to fill space (wider cards). <code>auto-fill</code>: Empty tracks preserved, so 3 cards stay at minimum width (narrower cards). Prof. Teeters: <em>\"Use auto-fit 99% of the time—it makes items expand beautifully!\"</em> Now I get it!"

Spans 2 of 3 columns—still featured. Mobile (375px)? Spans 2 of 2 columns—full width! The magic pattern calculated columns, spanning created asymmetry, everything still adapted intrinsically!"

      "title": "📦 Container Queries Saved My Life",
      "content": "My viewport-query card broke in a sidebar! Viewport said \"desktop\" (1440px) so <code>@media (min-width: 768px)</code> triggered horizontal layout—but the sidebar was only 300px wide! Card exploded! Prof. Teeters: <em>\"Stop asking 'How wide is the SCREEN?' Start asking 'How wide is MY CONTAINER?'\"</em> <code>@container (min-width: 400px)</code> fixed everything!"

      "title": "📏 Container Units = Mind Blown",
      "content": "Prof. Teeters showed me <code>padding: clamp(1rem, 0.5rem + 2cqi, 3rem)</code> and I understood EVERYTHING! <code>cqi</code> = 1% of container inline-size (width). Sidebar (300px container)? Padding is compact (0.5rem + 6px). Main content (900px container)? Padding is generous (0.5rem + 18px). <strong>SAME CSS, different containers, perfect adaptation!</strong>"

Image is 900×506. Always 16:9, always perfect, always intrinsic!"

It suggested <code>@media (min-width: 768px)</code> instead of <code>@container</code>.

      "content": "Prof. Teeters taught me to write <strong>CLAUDE.md</strong> with my project rules: \"Use hsl() colors only. Prefer container queries. Computed slopes required.\" Now AI <em>reads my rules first</em> and generates modern code! No more hex colors, no more arbitrary percentages, no more viewport queries!
